= Simple Kafka
:sectnums:

This demonstrates a Kafka Producer and Consumer within a single SpringBoot application.

* The Kafka messages are in AVRO format.
* The application by default accesses a Kafka cluster on localhost:9092.
* By default, the application starts its own embedded Kafka broker. If
the port 9092 is already in use, the application will not start its own
broker, but connect to the existing one.
* Optionally a full Kafka broker can be run via docker compose.

== Start the application

....
./gradlew bootRun
....

=== Start the application on a specific port

....
./gradlew bootRun --args='--server.port=8081'
....

== Access the application

=== springdoc-ui

In order to send messages the REST API can be used via UI here:

=== Show a JSON message as an AVRO hexdump

Using: https://httpie.io/

....
http --json POST http://localhost:8080/api/schema/user1/to-avro-hex/ name=Joe2 age:=8000
....

== Running a Kafka cluster, Kafdrop and CMAK (Cluster Manager for Apache Kafka)

This requires the "simple-kafka" application to be stopped beforehand,
as it would have started the embedded broker already.

....
docker compose up -d
....

=== Access Kafdrop

Open http://localhost:9006/

=== Access CMAK

. Open http://localhost:9000/
. Only the first time, Cluster/"Add Cluster":
* Cluster Name: Cluster1
* Cluster Zookeeper Hosts: localhost:2181
